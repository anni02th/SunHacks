## Problem Statement
Develop an AI-driven climate control system for air conditioners that optimizes energy efficiency and user comfort by analyzing environmental factors, occupancy patterns, and user preferences in real-time.

## Theme
AI/ML

## Description
The project aims to create a smart HVAC management system that leverages artificial intelligence and machine learning techniques to enhance energy efficiency and sustainability while ensuring optimal user comfort. By collecting data from environmental sensors, occupancy sensors, and weather prediction sources, the system will analyze and optimize climate settings in real-time. Additionally, dynamic scheduling and proactive notifications will be implemented to further improve efficiency and user experience.

## Expected Features
1. **Environmental Sensing**: Utilize sensors to collect data on temperature, humidity, air quality, and sunlight intensity inside and outside the building.
2. **Weather Prediction Data**: Analyze weather prediction data to proactively adjust temperature levels.
3. **Occupancy Detection**: Incorporate occupancy sensors to detect the presence of people in different areas of the building and adjust climate settings accordingly.
4. **AI Optimization**: Implement machine learning algorithms to analyze AC temperature and humidity data, historical sensor data, weather predictions, and user preferences. The AI model will learn occupancy patterns over time and optimize climate settings to maximize comfort while minimizing energy consumption.
5. **Dynamic Scheduling**: Automatically adjust climate settings based on the time of day, day of the week, and specific events (e.g., meetings, work hours) to ensure optimal comfort and efficiency.
6. **Proactive Notification**: Generate proactive notifications to set the AC temperature for a day based on data analysis.

## Technologies Used
- **IoT Sensors Dataset**: Utilize IoT sensors dataset for collecting environmental and occupancy data. Dataset parameters include timestamp, sensor name, location, temperature value, and humidity value.
- **Machine Learning**: Implement machine learning algorithms for data analysis and prediction using sensor data, AC temperature readings, climate changes, and environmental impact.
- **GUI**: Develop a web interface for users to interact with the climate control system.
